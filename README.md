#  MyHome - Data Engineering Project

## Overview

This **Data Engineering Project** is an implementation of the data pipeline which consumes data for each Wyze Room Sensor associated to my Wyze Thermostat. The script allows for a variable of storage methods for the output data [AWS S3 Bucket, Azure Storage Blob, or PostgreSQL], if you do not want to store the data, you can choose 'Print' (default chose) and the results are displayed and not stored.
